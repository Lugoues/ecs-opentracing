# ecs-opentracing
This repository demonstrates tracing of two sample applications, Java and Python deployed on ECS, using two OpenTracing providers, OpenZipkin - http://zipkin.io/ and Jaeger - https://uber.github.io/jaeger/ . Both the Applications and the OpenTracing providers will run as Tasks on an Amazon ECS cluster.
